This report gives an overview of the performance on the refactor repo at commit
`86acd4d319a755e0a05593f400ba636363630eba`.
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
read_rds("../benchmarking/at_86acd")
```
Before any optimization, the mean was about 0.8 for read and 0.9 for read and 
write.
Changing the approach and use dplyr instead of nested lapplyr and some other
modifications slightly slows down the performance. However, there is now a 
progress bar.
```{r}
read_rds("../benchmarking/at_86acd")
```

Also, it was possible to use `stringr` for matching
```{r}
read_rds("../benchmarking/at_86acd_dplyr_parse_one2.rds")
```

Further more, multipel strings were matched with one regex call
```{r}
read_rds("../benchmarking/at_86acd_dplyr_parse_one2_extract_multiple.rds")
```
